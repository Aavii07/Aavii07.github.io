            <p>Below are a few snapshots capturing the experience of winter. Each one captures a different feeling.</p>

                <img src="./images/cabin.jpeg" alt="Isolated cabin on frozen lake" class="wide-rounded-img">
                <p class="photo-description">A lone fishing hut atop a frozen lake away from the city. I tried to capture the vastness of
                    the lake combined with the isolation of the hut in this photo by showing the emptiness and distance from the warm,
                    glowing lights.

            </div>

            <div class="photo-item">
                <img src="./images/bench.jpeg" alt="An empty bench facing the lake" class="wide-rounded-img">
                <p class="photo-description">A small wooden bench surrounded by woodland facing the vast lake.
                    I tried to shoot this photo more dramatically, framing it with tree branches, darkening it, 
                    and adding some vignette.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="photo-item">
                <img src="./images/woods.jpeg" alt="The woods in the middle of winter" class="wide-rounded-img">
                <p class="photo-description">A quiet trail winding through dense winter forestry. This photo is much
                    more bright and popping to contrast the bench photo. I tried to capture the otherworldly parts 
                    of winter wilderness.
